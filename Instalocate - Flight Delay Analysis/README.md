# InstaLocate Machine Learning Internship
## Prediciting flight delays 

### Install

This project requires **Python 3** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org/)
- [Numpy](http://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)


You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

You could just install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 


### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory  (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Flight\ Delay\ Analysis.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Flight\ Delay\ Analysis.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
